		<p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, a ~4.6-billion-year-old, hot ball of hydrogen and helium plasma that generates light and heat through nuclear fusion. It is roughly 109 times the diameter of Earth and contains about 99.8% of the solar system's total mass. The Sun's light and heat are essential for life on Earth, providing the energy plants need for photosynthesis and the warmth to maintain a livable temperature.</p>
