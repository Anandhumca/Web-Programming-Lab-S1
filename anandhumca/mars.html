	<p>Mars, also called the "Red Planet," is a cold, dusty, desert world that is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is about half the size of Earth, with a rocky surface rich in iron oxide, which gives it its distinctive red color. Mars has a thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, polar ice caps, and features like volcanoes, canyons, and dry lakebeds.</p>
