	<p>Earth is our home planet, the third from the Sun and the only known place to harbor life, thanks to its unique combination of liquid water, a life-sustaining atmosphere, and a protective magnetic field. It's a rotating, spherical rocky planet, about 4.5 billion years old, with 71% of its surface covered by water. Internally, Earth has a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a thick rocky mantle, and a thin outer crust where life exists.</p>
